### ROM (return on materials)

Profit after tax divided by net virgin materials used in kg

### Inflow circularity

How circular the materials are that the company sources  
How much of the material is from recycled sources
circular inflow (non virgin material) / total inflow

### Outflow circularity

How circular the materials are that the company produces  
How much of the products that the company produces can be recycled  
recoverable outflow / total outflow

### Circularity

How much of the materials you are bringing back into the supply chain VS going into the landfil  
Shows how much of the materials used are kept in circulation  
Is the avarage of inflow and outflow circularity  
(inflow_circularity + outflow_circularity) / 2  
Companies are willing to pay extra for this
